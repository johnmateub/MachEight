# MachEight

The project is to write a function that searches through NBA player heights
based on user input. The raw data is taken from
[here](https://www.openintro.org/data/index.php?data=nba_heights).  The data is
served in json format by the endpoint
[here](https://mach-eight.uc.r.appspot.com/).

The task is to create an application that takes a single integer input. The
application will download the raw data from the website above
(https://mach-eight.uc.r.appspot.com) and print a list of all pairs of players
whose height in inches adds up to the integer input to the application. If no
matches are found, the application will print "No matches found"

Sample output is as follows:
```
> app 139

- Brevin Knight         Nate Robinson
- Nate Robinson         Mike Wilks
```

# Runnnig Process

of players.
